## Overview <a name="Overview"></a>

Currently package provides helpers to connect to YDB inside yandex-cloud.

## About semantic versioning <a name="SemVer"></a>

We follow the **[SemVer 2.0.0](https://semver.org)**. In particular, we provide backward compatibility in the `MAJOR` releases. New features without loss of backward compatibility appear on the `MINOR` release. In the minor version, the patch number starts from `0`. Bug fixes and internal changes are released with the third digit (`PATCH`) in the version.

There are, however, some changes with the loss of backward compatibility that we consider to be `MINOR`:
* extension or modification of internal `ydb-go-yc` interfaces. We understand that this will break the compatibility of custom implementations of the `ydb-go-yc` internal interfaces. But we believe that the internal interfaces of `ydb-go-yc` are implemented well enough that they do not require custom implementation. We are working to ensure that all internal interfaces have limited access only inside `ydb-go-yc`.
* major changes to (including removal of) the public interfaces and types that have been previously exported by `ydb-go-yc`. We understand that these changes will break the backward compatibility of early adopters of these interfaces. However, these changes are generally coordinated with early adopters and have the concise interfacing with `ydb-go-yc` as a goal.

Internal interfaces outside from `internal` directory are marked with comment such as
```
// Warning: only for internal usage inside ydb-go-yc
```

We publish the planned breaking `MAJOR` changes:
* via the comment `Deprecated` in the code indicating what should be used instead
* through the file [`NEXT_MAJOR_RELEASE.md`](#NEXT_MAJOR_RELEASE.md)
